## Hello Fabulous People ðŸ’–
I am Fabienne Olibrice, you can also refer to me as "Fabi". I am a second year undergraduate student at Florida International University. I am pursuing B.S.Computer Science and a M.N. in Mathematicl Sciences. The following is  little more about myself along with my interests and how I developed an interest in tech ðŸ¤©

As an African American young woman of Haitian descent, I have always been driven by a strong commitment to academics and community involvement. From a young age, I actively engaged in school through leadership roles and community service, which cultivated my passion for making a positive impact. My interest in technology began in middle school through participation in a STEM program, fueled by my love for math. This early exposure solidified my desire to pursue a career in tech, not only due to my genuine interest but also my dedication to addressing the gender gap in engineering fieldsâ€”a cause I find both important and valuable to advocate for.

Balancing my passion for technology with my feminine expression has been a unique challenge in the male-dominated STEM environment. Despite this, I embrace my identity as a "girly girl" who is equally enthusiastic about tech. Currently, as a college student, I am eager to explore new opportunities, continuously learn and grow along the way. This period of my life is marked by both expression and reflection as I navigate my path in the tech industry.

My participation in the FIU Society of Women Engineers chapter has significantly contributed towards this. Fostering a community of women while, promoting their professional development has been admirable. Even more filling as an executive board member who is actively apart of new advancements and partnerships. Beneficial not only for myself but, many of our members within diverse communities. I am very proud and grateful for these opportunities Florida International University has introduced to me. I cannot wait to see where this new journey leads me.
